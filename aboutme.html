            <p>
              After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
              I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews
              of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

        <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p>
           I like to think of myself as a lifelong
          learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create
          simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into
          existing projects. While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful
          to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the
          world. </p>
          <h3>How I got started</h3>
          <p> 
          I started simple and gradually grew my learning
          journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each
          learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
          but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
          <p>
          That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
          learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
